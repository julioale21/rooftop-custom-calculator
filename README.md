## The objetive

Your objetive is to build a custom calculator with two inputs, by default both must have value 0.

Optional: Create a numeric keyboard.

You should only be able to write numbers.

In each input there is a button that says "clear", when clicked on it the value should return to 0.

Below it should automatically show all the calculations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, square root and the hypotenuse
